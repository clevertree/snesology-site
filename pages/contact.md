Open-Source means the SNESology project is free forever, and anyone can join in the development,
so we're always looking for testers, artists, and all kinds of musician to 
[contribute](https://github.com/clevertree/snesology-web/issues/4).

Currently the composer is in
[inactive development](https://github.com/clevertree/snesology-web)
and has not yet been released.
