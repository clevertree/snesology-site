# The SNESology/AudioSource Project is no longer active. Thanks for visiting :)

```
The project was paused in late 2020 when it was clear we were entering 4 years of Bidenomics which features corporate sabotage and many clever techniques to keep open-source projects like this uncompetitive and obscure. Furthermore, the browser technology AudioSource was based on was not ready for prime-time. It was good enough to play back videos and mp3s, but rendering audio on most browsers is just not happening yet.

# SNESology Project Introduction
The __SNESology Project__ allows anyone with a web browser to compose and share original music based on the __Super Nintendo Entertainment System__ Sound chip, and other consoles too!
This DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) will focus on the original chiptune sound and allow users to create, edit, and publish their own songs, as well as view the 'source' of anyone else's published song.



## Featured Songs (Disabled)

## Web Browser Demo (Disabled)

## Project Goals

* Restore and remix classical chip-tune music
* Create and publish music with chip-tune instruments on any device
* Streaming Samples: No sample libraries to manage
* [Open Source](https://github.com/clevertree/snesology-web/) & Free forever


## AudioSource Composer Features
* Works on any modern browser on any phone, tablet or pc
* Instruments and effects can be wrapped in each other to build complex presets
* Note tracks can be called recursively for a highly structured song

## What's Currently Working
* Add, edit, and delete notes and note tracks
* Edit note velocity and duration
* Quarter tone compatibility
* Recursively play back tracks by adding a 'Track Note'
* Track note transposing (play back tracks at different frequencies)
* 432hz compatibility

## Under the Hood
* Built on WebAudio technology.
* Songs, instruments, and samples written for Audio Source will work on any device
* Audio Source Mobile brings the WebAudio API to mobile devices by using a WebView as a proxy
* Instruments render using React VirtualDOM on the UI thread while rendering audio in the WebView proxy

## Planned Features
* Chip support: C64, NES, SNES, Sega, PSx, and others
* Audio recording and editing
* Track XY Grid for easy mouse-click composition
* Real-time editing between multiple users (like Google Docs)
* Server-side song rendering
* Import/Export MIDI files
* Edit songs in real-time with your friends (like google docs)
* Hire professional services to take a WIP to the next level
